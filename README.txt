The "ComprobationAlgorithms" document presents a detailed mathematical derivation
 of the phase retrieval for the X-ray phase contrast method Inline. It also includes 
corresponding verifications with monochromatic Monte Carlo simulations, retrieving 
the projected thickness maps for each material and diameter. The "Data" file contains all the 
data in .txt format, organized into different files, such as the diameter and the material. 
The "ProcCodes" file includes all the processing codes, from the codes for the phase 
retrieval. Additional codes show how we calculate the contrast-to-noise ratio in the 
different regions of interest and the data in the graphs shown in the main document. 
Finally, the "SimulationsMcXCode" file contains the McXtrace codes to run the Monte 
Carlo simulations.
